# Clearhaus 3-D Secure v2 API Documentation

## Status

We at Clearhaus are currently in the process of developing our 3-D Secure
version 2 implementation. Post-implementation we need certification with EMVCo,
on-site PCI audit followed by certification with card schemes and deployment to
production.

It is too early to make any promises about schedule for deployment or, in fact,
most things. But we are working on it.

Using the terminology from the specification, we will be responsible for the
3DS Server, while we consider our technical partners to be 3DS Requestors.

## Specification

The 3-D Secure v2 specification is defined by EMVCo, their list of 3-D Secure v2
documentation can be found [on their documentation
page](https://www.emvco.com/document-search/?action=search_documents&publish_date=&emvco_document_version=&emvco_document_book=&px_search=&emvco_document_technology%5B%5D=3-d-secure).

Specifically, the primary documentation can be found in [EMVÂ® 3-D Secure
Protocol and Core Functions
Specification](https://www.emvco.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/EMVCo_3DS_Spec_v220_122018.pdf).
